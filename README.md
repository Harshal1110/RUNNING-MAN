The "Running Man" project is a graphical application developed in C++ to simulate a simple running game where a stick figure moves across the screen, encounters obstacles, and can jump to avoid collisions. The game visually represents motion by animating the figureâ€™s limbs in a swinging pattern, creating a sense of realistic running. By pressing the spacebar, the user can make the figure jump, allowing it to avoid obstacles in its path. If the spacebar is not pressed in time when near an obstacle, an alert prompts the user to jump.
This project showcases fundamental concepts in computer graphics, including basic animation techniques, user input handling, and collision detection, providing an engaging way for beginners to learn these principles. Through modular functions, the code simplifies complex actions, like limb movement and obstacle interaction, into clear, reusable functions. The use of external libraries like `<graphics.h>`, combined with foundational C++ programming, allows for an interactive experience that helps illustrate core concepts in graphics programming, animation, and real-time user interaction. This project is an ideal starting point for those interested in exploring graphical applications in C++.
